# Appengine with multi-app architecture

Appengine & TinkerBox

Created On: 22-Dec-2022

Goal:
1. One Appengine (extending CodeIgniter 3) to serve multiple apps
2. TinkerBox is a fictitious app. It serves as an Appengine development tool as well as a template for actual production app.
2. Appengine as well as other apps can have independent github repos 
3. Start new project (batteries included) by duplicating TinkerBox in 15 minutes
